# Autism Prediction

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a structured dataset. It emphasizes robust data preprocessing, insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA), and comparative modeling across multiple algorithms.

## Repository Structure

- **Autism dataset.csv** – Raw dataset containing features and target labels.
- **Autism_dataset_cleaned.csv** – Preprocessed dataset after cleaning and imputation.
- **Autism_dataset.sql** – SQL representation of the dataset for database operations.
- **Data Preprocessing.ipynb** – Notebook detailing cleaning, imputation, and feature engineering steps.
- **Data Visualization(EDA).ipynb** – Notebook for visual exploration and variable relationship analysis.
- **Model Building.ipynb** – Machine learning pipeline for training and evaluating models.
